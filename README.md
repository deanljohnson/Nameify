# Nameify
A procedural name generator written in JavaScript. The goal for this project is to generate names according to a randomly generated but pronouncable pattern. Nameify will not require a long list of names in order to "learn" from. Instead, we build names based on randomly chosen linguistic rules. The problem with the list of names approach is that it produces names like that list, which is not the intention of this project. This project will produce a list of names that are self-similar, but not necessarily similar to languages that exist currently. With this method, Nameify will be particularly well suited to generating names for procedurally generated races in games, which is what I plan to use this for.
